1. findIter @ CollectionManipulator needs comparator support
2. need for implicit conversion to value from initializer list -- difficulties
3. const traverse and mold to one
#4. fix comparator specializations
5. da empty initializer problem (std::map takes std::less function which uses empty constructor)
